+ **Commitment**
    - Regular attendance is mandatory. If unable to attend a meeting, each member should notify the leaders well in advance. We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and that is why **_communication is key_**. Feel free to reach out to us, and together we can find a solution!
